# MSSE 272 — Project 2: Lennard-Jones Metropolis Simulation

This project implements a 2D Monte Carlo simulation using the **Metropolis algorithm** with a **Lennard–Jones (LJ) potential**.  
It was completed as part of **CHEM 272: Python for Molecular Sciences** in the UC Berkeley **Master of Molecular Science & Software Engineering (MSSE)** program.

The project includes:

- A **C++ implementation** for fast simulation  
- A **Python implementation** for analysis and visualization  
- The original **scientific report** describing methods and results  
- A clean project structure suitable for employers and researchers

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment was to explore **particle interactions and thermodynamic sampling** using the LJ potential:

\[
\phi(r) = \frac{a}{r^{12}} - \frac{b}{r^6}
\]

The Metropolis algorithm is used to probabilistically accept/reject trial moves:

\[
P(\text{accept}) = \min\left(1, \exp[-\beta \Delta U]\right)
\]

Both **random-scan** and **all-at-once** update strategies are implemented.
